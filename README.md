# WorkDayScheduler
Every workday can look a bit different, and sometimes it is easier to take stock day by day. With this website, you can take an eagle-eye view of your day and chart your course from 9:00 in the morning to 18:00 in the evening. (This site uses 24hrs instead of am and pm.)

Here's a little preview of the site itself:
